# simple-regression-example

This is an exploration of the main techniques used in linear regression.

Notes:
+ The main code is the R Markdown simple_regression.Rmd. However, to explore the notebook online, use the simple_regression.md file.
+ R version: 3.5.1.
+ Packages needed: c("dplyr", "skimr", "ggfortify", "corrplot", "ggplot2", "GGally" and "fitdistrplus").

Steps:

1. Descriptive analysis was performed in a different notebook: descriptive_statistics.Rmd.

2. Dataset preprocessing. 

3. Simple linear regressin model. 

4. PCA transformation, Stepwise model selection and interactions exploration.

5. Model diagnostics.

6. Code for ridge and lasso regression is provided in the separate notebook constrained_regression.Rmd
